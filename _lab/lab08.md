# Introduction

In this lab, you will utilize a Binary Search Tree to store and organize courses.

A course is uniquely identified by its department code and course ID (e.g., CMPSC 9 has the department code `"CMPSC"` and the course ID `9`). In addition to these two attributes, a course also has a course name, a lecture, and several sections.

You will store the details of each course in a binary search tree node defined by class `CourseCatalogNode` and organize all the courses in a binary search tree defined by class `CourseCatalog`. The nodes will be ordered first by department code in lexicographical order, and then by course ID in numerical order.

You will also write a test file to verify your implementation. Note: While this lab writeup provides sample test cases for reference, the Gradescope autograder will use different, more complex test cases.

**Note: It is important that you start this lab early so you can utilize our office hours to seek assistance / ask clarifying questions during the weekdays before the deadline if needed!**

# Instructions

You will need to create four files:
* `Event.py`
* `CourseCatalogNode.py`
* `CourseCatalog.py`
* `testFile.py`

## Event.py

The `Event.py` file will contain the definition of the `Event` class, which is used to represent the lecture and the section. The `Event` class is structured as follows:

* Attributes:

    * `day` - a string representing the event days. It is a combination of `"M"`, `"T"`, `"W"`, `"R"`, `"F"` (e.g., `"MW"`, `"TR"`, `"F"`)
    * `time` - a tuple of two integers representing the event's start and end times, using a 24-hour format. For example, `(1530, 1645)` indicates an event starts at 15:30 (3:30 PM) and ends at 16:45 (4:45 PM)
    * `location` - a string representing the event's location. **Note, this attribute is stored in uppercase**

* Methods:

    * `__init__(self, day, time, location)` - initializes an `Event` object with the specified day, time, and location
    * `__eq__(self, rhs)` - compares two events for equality. Two events are considered identical if they have the same day, time, and location
    * `__str__(self)` - returns a string representation of the event in the format: `"[day] [time], [location]"`

**Example:**

```python
e1 = Event("TR", (1530, 1645), "td-w 1701")
e2 = Event("TR", (1530, 1645), "td-w 1702")
print(e1 == e2)
print(e1)
```

**Output:**
```
False
TR 15:30 - 16:45, TD-W 1701
```

ðŸ”§ The following is a helper function you can use to convert the time attribute, a `(int, int)` tuple, to a readable string.

```python
def format(time):
    return f"{time[0]//100:0>2}:{time[0]%100:0>2} - {time[1]//100:0>2}:{time[1]%100:0>2}"

assert format((800, 1550)) == "08:00 - 15:50"
```

## CourseCatalogNode.py

The `CourseCatalogNode.py` file will contain the definition of the `CourseCatalogNode` class, which is used to represent a course in a Binary Search Tree. Each node's key is determined by a course's department code and course ID. **The nodes are ordered first by department code in lexicographical order, followed by course ID in numerical order**. The `CourseCatalogNode` class is structured as follows:

* Attributes:

    * `department` - a string representing the department code of the course, which serves as the first key of the node. **You need to store this attribute in uppercase**
    * `courseId` - an integer representing the course ID, which serves as the second key of the node
    * `courseName` - a string representing the name of the course. **You need to store this attribute in uppercase**
    * `lecture` - an `Event` object that stores the lecture's day, time, and location
    * `sections` - a list of `Event` objects, where each element stores a section's day, time, and location
    * `parent` - the reference to a parent node. This attribute is `None` if it has no parent (it is the root)
    * `left` - the reference to a left child node. This attribute is `None` if it has no left child
    * `right` - the reference to a right child node. This attribute is `None` if it has no right child

* Methods:

    * `__init__(self, department, courseId, courseName, lecture, sections)` - initializes an `CourseCatalogNode` object with the specified parameters
    * `__str__(self)` - returns a string representation of the course including the lecture and sections (if any). See example format below:

**Example:**

```python
# create one lecture event
lecture = Event("TR", (1530, 1645), "td-w 1701")

# create four section events
section1 = Event("W", (1400, 1450), "north hall 1109")
section2 = Event("W", (1500, 1550), "north hall 1109")
section3 = Event("W", (1600, 1650), "north hall 1109")
section4 = Event("W", (1700, 1750), "girvetz hall 1112")
sections = [section1, section2, section3, section4]

# initialize a CMPSC 9 course node
node = CourseCatalogNode("cmpsc", 9, "intermediate python", lecture, sections)

print(node)
```

**Output:**
```
CMPSC 9: INTERMEDIATE PYTHON
 * Lecture: TR 15:30 - 16:45, TD-W 1701
 + Section: W 14:00 - 14:50, NORTH HALL 1109
 + Section: W 15:00 - 15:50, NORTH HALL 1109
 + Section: W 16:00 - 16:50, NORTH HALL 1109
 + Section: W 17:00 - 17:50, GIRVETZ HALL 1112

```
**Note that each Event (lecture and sections) will contain a `\n` character at the end of the line. Also note the single space at the start of each lecture / section line.**

## CourseCatalog.py

The `CourseCatalog.py` file will contain the definition of the `CourseCatalog` class, which is a Binary Search Tree that manages all `CourseCatalogNode` objects keyed by `department` and `courseId`. An example Binary Search Tree structure is illustrated below when the course keys (`department` and `courseId`) are inserted in the following order:
1. `CMPSC`, `9`
2. `CMPSC`, `270`
3. `CMPSC`, `8`
4. `PSTAT`, `131`

![example.png](example.png)

The `CourseCatalog` class is structured according to the specifications below. Gradescope will test all methods listed below, but your solution can contain (and is recommended to use) additional helper methods that support the functionality.

* Attributes:

    * `root` - the root of the tree. **Note: CourseCatalog should only have 1 attribute `root`. Any extra attribute may break the test code**

* Methods:

    * `__init__(self)` - initializes an empty binary search tree.
    * `addCourse(self, department, courseId, courseName, lecture, sections)` - returns a boolean value. Insert a course into the binary search tree. If a course with the same `department` and `courseId` already exists, return `False` and do nothing. Otherwise, insert a new course node in the Binary Search Tree and return `True`. **Note: The `department` parameter may not necessarily be in uppercase**
    * `addSection(self, department, courseId, section)` - returns a boolean value. Insert a section into the Binary Search Tree to the course identified by `department` and `courseId`. If the course does not exist, return `False` and do nothing. Otherwise, append the new section to the end of the corresponding node's sections list (`sections`) and return `True`. **Note: The `department` parameter may not necessarily be in uppercase**
    * `inOrder(self)` - returns a string containing the information for all courses using an in-order traversal of the Binary Search Tree
    * `preOrder(self)` - returns a string containing the information for all courses using a pre-order traversal of the Binary Search Tree
    * `postOrder(self)` - returns a string containing the information for all courses using a post-order traversal of the Binary Search Tree
    * `getAttendableSections(self, department, courseId, availableDay, availableTime)` - given a course identified by `department` and `courseId`, finds all sections of it held on `availableDay` and within the time period `availableTime`. Returns a string containing the information of all such sections. An empty string is returned if there are no attendable sections. **Note: The `department` parameter may not necessarily be in uppercase**
    * `countCoursesByDepartment(self)` - returns a dictionary. Counts the number of courses in each department within the binary search tree. The keys of the dictionary are department codes, and the values are integers representing the count of courses in the corresponding department

**Example:**

```python
cc = CourseCatalog()

# add a new course: cmpsc 9
lecture = Event("TR", (1530, 1645), "td-w 1701")
section1 = Event("W", (1400, 1450), "north hall 1109")
section2 = Event("W", (1500, 1550), "north hall 1109")
section3 = Event("W", (1600, 1650), "north hall 1109")
section4 = Event("W", (1700, 1750), "girvetz hall 1112")
sections = [section1, section2, section3, section4]
assert True == cc.addCourse("cmpsc", 9, "intermediate python", lecture, sections)

# add a new section to cmpsc 9
section5 = Event("F", (0, 2359), "fluent-python-in-one-day hall 101")
assert True == cc.addSection("cmpsc", 9, section5)

# add a new course: art 10
lecture = Event("TR", (1300, 1550), "arts 2628")
sections = []
assert True == cc.addCourse("art", 10, "introduction to painting", lecture, sections)

print("----- in-order traversal -----")
print(cc.inOrder())

print("----- pre-order traversal -----")
print(cc.preOrder())

print("----- post-order traversal -----")
print(cc.postOrder())

print("Task: find all cmpsc 9 sections held on Wednesday and within 15:00 - 17:00 time period")
print(cc.getAttendableSections("cmpsc", 9, "W", (1500, 1700)))

print("Task: count courses by department")
print(cc.countCoursesByDepartment())
```

**Output:**
```

## testFile.py

This file should contain tests for all classes and their required methods, written using `pytest`. Ensure you consider various scenarios and edge cases when designing your tests. Every method of each class should be tested with various cases.

Be sure to run your tests locally to help debug and verify that your code functions correctly. Remember, testing is important!

# Submission

Once you have completed your class definitions and tests, submit the following files to Gradescopeâ€™s Lab08 assignment:

* `Event.py`
* `CourseCatalogNode.py`
* `CourseCatalog.py`
* `testFile.py`

Gradescope will run a variety of unit tests to verify that your code works correctly according to the specifications provided in this lab.

If the tests donâ€™t pass, you may get some error messages that may not be immediately clear. Donâ€™t worry â€” take a moment to consider what might have caused the error, and double-check the instructions to ensure your code is following the specifications precisely. Consider writing additional test cases for various scenarios / edge cases to help you debug any issues. If you're still unsure why the error is occurring, feel free to ask your TAs or Learning Assistants for assistance.
